## Overview
- Welcome to the Higher-Order Functions Assessment! This exercise will guide you in implementing six functions using higher-order methods such as map(), filter(), forEach(), and reduce().
- The purpose is to practice writing efficient, functional code to manipulate arrays and return expected results.

## Objective
- The main objective of this assessment is to:
- Understand the usage of higher-order functions in JavaScript.
- Gain hands-on experience using map(), filter(), forEach(), and reduce().
- Write functions that perform operations on sample arrays and return the result as required.

## Task Descriptions
1. squareArray(arr)
- Objective: Use map() to square each element in the numbers array.

2. uppercaseArray(arr)
- Objective: Use map() to convert all elements in the words array to uppercase.

3. filterEvenNumbers(arr)
- Objective: Use filter() to return only even numbers from the numbers array.

4. formatElements(arr)
- Objective: Use forEach() to create formatted strings from the letters array and return the new array.


5. filterLongWords(arr)
- Objective: Use filter() to return only words longer than 4 characters from the words array.

6. sumArray(arr)
- Objective: Use reduce() to calculate the sum of all elements in the numbers array.

## Submission Guidelines
- Ensure all six functions are implemented correctly.
- Run the tests to verify your code passes all cases.

## Test Cases
- should square each element in the numbers array	8marks
- should convert all words to uppercase	6marks
- should filter even numbers from the numbers array	6marks
- should create formatted strings from the letters array	8marks
- should filter words longer than 4 characters	6marks
- should sum all elements in the numbers array 6marks
